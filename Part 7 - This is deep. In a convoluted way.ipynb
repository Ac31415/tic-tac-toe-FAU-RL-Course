    "The one trick that we haven't used yet is the use of [Convolutional Neural Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network) (CNN) layers. So far, we have fed the board state into the Neural Network as a 1d array. This makes it hard for the Neural Network to exploit the inherently 2D nature of the board though.\n",

    "CNN layers can slide a 2D window over the board-state and thus learn about 2 dimensional patterns:\n",

    "And indeed, many contemporary NN approaches to learning how to play board games use CNN layers as part of their topology. The most prominent exmaple being [Alpha Go](https://deepmind.com/blog/alphago-zero-learning-scratch/) by Deep Mind. If it's good enough for them, it should be good enough for us. We'll take the NN from our previous part and simply pop a few CNN layers on top:\n",

    "# Some other changes while we are at it\n",
    "There are two more smaller changes we make at this stage. We add regularization loss and [TensorBoard](https://www.tensorflow.org/programmers_guide/summaries_and_tensorboard) support.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Regularization Loss\n",
    "One problem Neural Networks can face is that weights get increasingly large. This in turn can cause numerical instabilities. A straight forward approach to dealing with this, is to define a loss based on how large the weights are and add this to the total loss function of the Neural Network. This gives the training step an incentive to keep weights small. \n",
    "\n",
    "We need to balance the regularization loss with the rest of the loss function however to avoid the Neural Network optimizing the regularization loss at the expense of a higher loss in our Q function. We don't want this.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code this means, we add a `kernel_regularizer` to every layer, e.g. like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "return tf.layers.dense(input_tensor, output_size, activation=activation_fn,\n",
    "                       kernel_initializer=tf.contrib.layers.variance_scaling_initializer(),\n",
    "                       kernel_regularizer=tf.contrib.layers.l1_l2_regularizer(),\n",
    "                       name=name)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We then add the regularization loss to the total loss:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "self.reg_losses = tf.identity(tf.get_collection(tf.GraphKeys.REGULARIZATION_LOSSES, scope=name),\n",
    "                              name=\"reg_losses\")\n",
    "reg_loss = self.beta * tf.reduce_mean(self.reg_losses)\n",
    "\n",
    "self.total_loss = tf.add(self.loss, reg_loss, name=\"total_loss\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "with `self.beta` being a factor smaller than 1 to scale down `reg_loss` and prevent it from dominating the optimization process.\n",
    "\n",
    "## TensorBoard support\n",
    "The 2nd change we are making is to add support for TensorBoard. TensorBoard is a dashboard that comes with TensorFlow the helps visualizing NN graphs as well as all kinds of metrics around training and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, the only metric we looked at as the win-loss-draw ratio out NN achieved. By using TensorBoard we might be able to get some additional insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to do this, we need to create a summary writer, write to it, and in the end close it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "sess = TFSessionManager.get_session()\n",
    "writer = tf.summary.FileWriter(TENSORLOG_DIR, sess.graph)\n",
    "[...]\n",

    "        self.writer.add_summary(summary, self.game_counter)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Some changes in hyper parameters\n",
    "\n",

    "def __init__(self, name: str, reward_discount: float = 0.99, win_value: float = 10.0, draw_value: float = 0.0,\n",
    "                 loss_value: float = -10.0, learning_rate: float = 0.01, training: bool = True,\n",
    "                 random_move_prob: float = 0.9999, random_move_decrease: float = 0.9997, batch_size=60,\n",
    "                 pre_training_games: int = 500, tau: float = 0.001):\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, we do random moves for longer, discount the reward less, and changed the win and loss rewards by a factor of 10.\n",
