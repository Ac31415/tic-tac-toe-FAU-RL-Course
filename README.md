# Tic Tac Toe
## A Cautionary tale about teaching a machine to play tic tac toe through Reinforcement Learning

The goal of this series is to implement and test a couple of different approaches to 
teaching a computer how to play **Tic Tac Toe**. We will create:

* A player that plays completely randomly, 
* Two players that implement simple forms of the Min-Max algorithm, 
* Several players that we will train through Reinforcement Learning:
    * a Tabular Q-Learning player
    * a Neural Q Network player
    * a Neural Policy Network player

I assume you are familiar with:
* The rules and basic strategy of playing Tic Tac Toe
* Basic Python 3 programming and use of an IDE our Jupyter Notebook
* At least rudimentary knowledge of Tensorflow and Neural Networks (if you have done a couple of the beginner 
tutorials, you should be fine)
