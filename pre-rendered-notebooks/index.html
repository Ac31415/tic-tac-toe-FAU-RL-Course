<h1>Teaching a computer to play Tic Tac Toe</h1>

<h2>From classic algorithms to Reinforcement learning with Neural Networks</h2>
<p>
In this series of articles we will explore a number of different approaches to teaching a computer how to play the
famous board game

<p> Most people will be familiar with <a href="https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FTic-tac-toe"
                                         rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Tic Tac Toe</a>
    and more than likely have played it at some stage of their life. </p>

<p >The game is rather simple. With respect to its rules as well as its strategy. In fact, it can be played by
    young children and can a board can sometimes even be found at playgrounds:</p>

<p>If you have played Tic Tac Toe a couple of times you will quickly have noticed that it is quite easy to master.
    You will most likely also have discovered that when both players play good moves, the game will always end in a
    draw.</p>

    Tic Tac Toe to look at various approaches to teaching a computer to play this game. Not because Tic Tac Toe is
    particularly challanging, but because it gives us a conistent, easy to understand target.

    <p>We will look at
    the classic Min Max algorithm, a tabular reinforcement learning approach
    as well as a couple of Neural Network based reinforcement learning approaches:</p>
